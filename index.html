        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. A global coordinated effort is needed to stop the further spread of the virus. A pandemic is defined as “occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population." The last pandemic reported in the world was the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.

            On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China, was reported to the World Health Organisation. In January 2020, a previously unknown new virus was identified, subsequently named the 2019 novel coronavirus, and samples obtained from cases and analysis of the virus’ genetics indicated that this was the cause of the outbreak. This novel coronavirus was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO in February 2020. The virus is referred to as SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease is COVID-19.</p>

        <h1>What IsCoronavirus?</h1>
        <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness such as respiratory diseases or gastrointestinal diseases. Respiratory diseases can range from the common cold to more severe diseases eg
            Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)
            Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).
            A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been identified in humans previously. Once scientists determine exactly what coronavirus it is, they give it a name (as in the case of COVID-19, the virus causing it is SARS-CoV-2).
            
            Coronaviruses got their name from the way that they look under a microscope. The virus consists of a core of genetic material surrounded by an envelope with protein spikes. This gives it the appearance of a crown. The word Corona means “crown” in Latin.
            
            Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning that the viruses are transmitted between animals and humans. It has been determined that MERS-CoV was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans and SARS-CoV from civet cats to humans.  The source of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is yet to be determined, but investigations are ongoing to identify the zoonotic source to the outbreak.</p>

        <h2>READ:</h2>
        <p>Typically Coronaviruses present with respiratory symptoms. Among those who will become infected, some will show no symptoms. Those who do develop symptoms may have a mild to moderate, but self-limiting disease with symptoms similar to the seasonal flu. Symptoms may include:</br> 

            Respiratory symptoms</br>
            Fever</br>
            Cough</br>
            Shortness of breath</br>
            Breathing difficulties</br>
            Fatigue</br>
            Sore throat</br>
            A minority group of people will present with more severe symptoms and will need to be hospitalised, most often with pneumonia, and in some instances, the illness can include ARDS, sepsis and septic shock.  Emergency warning signs where immediate medical attention should be sought include:</br>
            
            Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</br>
            Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</br>
            New confusion or inability to arouse</br>
            Bluish lips or face</p>
